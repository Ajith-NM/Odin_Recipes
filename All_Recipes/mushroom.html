    <h1>Mushroom Pepper Fry</h1>

    <img src="../images/mushroom-pepper-fry.webp" alt="Mushroom Pepper Fry" width="300px" height="300px">
    <p>This preparation is super easy and simple, and makes for a fantastic spicy mushroom and capsicum fry. Rest of the
        ingredients too are all the basic ones, which are usually available at any Indian home kitchen. Since I have
        cooked it in coconut oil and it also has curry leaves, I refer to it as a South Indian style preparation. The
        recipe is vegan and gluten free too.</p>

        <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Mushrooms</li>
        <li>Coconut oil</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>Green capsicum</li>
        <li>Black peppercorns and Fennel seeds </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Firstly, take 1 tablespoon black peppercorns and 1 teaspoon fennel seeds in a dry grinder or coffee grinder.

            If you are not going to add capsicum in the recipe, then reduce the black pepper to ½ tablespoon and fennel
            seeds to ½ teaspoon.</li>
        <li>Grind to a coarse powder. Keep aside. Also, slice 1 large onion, 250 grams white button mushrooms, 1 medium
            to large capsicum and 1 green chili.

            Rinse the mushrooms a few times in water using a colander or strainer before you chop them.</li>

            Rinse the mushrooms a few times in water using a colander or strainer before you chop them.</li>
        <li> Then, add 1 cup thinly sliced onions.</li>
        <li> Mix the onions very well and sauté on low to medium heat.</li>
        <li> For quick cooking of the onions, you can add a pinch of salt while sautéing. Sauté till they start to turn
            light golden.Then, add ½ teaspoon ginger-garlic paste.</li>
        <li>Stir and sauté till the raw aroma of ginger-garlic goes away.</li>
        <li>Now, add the sliced mushrooms.</li>
        <li> Mix very well and sauté on medium heat.First, the mushrooms will release a lot of water. Continue to sauté
            till all the water has evaporated.</li>
        <li>Then, add 1 cup thinly sliced green capsicum. Mix well.Sauté the capsicum slices till they are half cooked.
            They should have some crunch in them.</li>
        <li>Then, add sliced green chili and 2 teaspoons chopped curry leaves. Mix well.Next, add the prepared spice
            powder.</li>
        <li> Next, add ½ teaspoon coriander powder, ½ teaspoon cumin powder and a pinch of turmeric powder.Mix all the
            spice powders very well. Season with salt.</li>

            coriander leaves. Stir.</li>
